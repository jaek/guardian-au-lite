## Young Australians on welfare regularly skip meals and couchsurf, survey findsYoung people on welfare are regularly skipping meals and couchsurfing, with a new survey finding that the majority are living on less than $14 a day after paying rent.

 A report, based on an internet survey of 892 people between the ages of 16 and 30, found that more than 60% of respondents had less than $100 per week left after paying rent, and 37% were left with less than $50 a week.

 The survey, undertaken by the National Union of Students, YOUNG Campaigns and the Australian Council of Social Service, presents a snapshot of the financial stress faced by young people living on Youth Allowance and Newstart.

  Of those surveyed, 75.2% were on the Youth Allowance payment, which pays a maximum amount of $455.20 per fortnight for a single person with no children, and 19.4% received the Newstart allowance of $559 a fortnight.

 The report comes as a Senate inquiry examines the adequacy of Newstart and related payments, and as advocates lobby for an increase to the unemployment benefit of at least $75 a week.

 According to the new report, released on Thursday, food and housing costs are causing a large amount of stress for young people, with just over half of those surveyed reporting they had to couchsurf or use other forms of unstable accommodation as a result of financial pressure.

 When asked how often meals were skipped to save money or because they could not afford it, 90% said that they had to skip at least one meal a week, while almost 30% skipped six or more meals a week.

 Just over one in five (22%) said that they had to skip meals every day.

 The cost of living squeeze has seen 80% of participants struggle with costs for essential study items and course fees, with 35% reporting they had withdrawn from studies due to financial stress.

 Medical and dental costs were also a burden, with 73% reporting problems with accessing essential services, such as filling prescriptions, or seeing specialists, and 74% of participants saying it had been over a year since they saw a dentist.

     The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said the findings made clear that the rate of the payments were “not enough to get through tough times”.

 “It’s not right that we have young people skipping meals, going without medication or a safe place to live,” Goldie said.

 “The deep and constant financial stress of trying to get by on Newstart or Youth Allowance makes it incredibly difficult to focus on studies or to put your best foot forward when trying to find paid work.”

 The survey also canvassed the mental health ramifications of the payment, with 92% of participants saying that the low rate made them feel isolated, and 90% reporting negative mental health impacts.

 Adriana Malavisi, the welfare officer from the National Union of Students, said that while it was known that the rates of Youth Allowance and Newstart were “inadequate”, the survey had exposed the types of situations young people were enduring.

 “Young people are living in unsafe and insecure homes, they’re skipping meals every day, and it’s affecting their studies. It’s simply not good enough,” Malavisi said.

 “Students should not be forced to live in poverty while studying.”
