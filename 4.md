 **Labor have denied Angus Taylor a voting pair to enable the besieged energy minister to attend key climate talks in Europe next week,** telling the member for Hume it would be inappropriate for him to miss the final sitting week of parliament for the year while there was a live police investigation against him. Taylor faces intense scrutiny over attacks he made on Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, based off a potentially falsified version of a Sydney city council report. It follows a bad evening in federal parliament for the Coalition after One Nation stunningly rejected its “ensuring integrity” bill at the 11th-hour, a bill that critics had called draconian in its powers to deregister unions and disqualify union officials. As political editor Katharine Murphy writes, the unexpected defeat tops Scott Morrison’s worst week as prime minister.

 **Employment and skills minister Michaelia Cash has defended the appointment of a former Liberal staffer to a $500,000-a-year-job via limited tender, **telling Guardian Australia he had an “impressive CV” and was appointed after an “open, merit-driven, competitive process”. Adam Boyton was originally awarded the role as interim national skills commissioner “due to an absence of competition for technical reasons”, but this was later amended in the Austender entry. The former chief of staff to NSW Liberal leader John Brogden has also been the chief economist at the Business Council of Australia, with the ACTU raising concerns over his suitability for the role.

 **Australia is under pressure from conservationists to revise its Great Barrier Reef policy,** with the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia accusing the island nation of “not walking the walk” in its climate change commitments. A report released today by WWF-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society says the country must show it has fresh plans to attack the Great Barrier Reef’s two key threats – climate change and water quality – in its official government report to the UN’s world heritage committee to be released next week. Today’s report details what they say Australia needs to do to avoid the committee placing the reef on its “in danger” list when it meets in China next year.

Photograph: Lynne Sladky/AP   **Recently sacked Navy secretary Richard Spencer has penned a scathing attack on president Donald Trump,** saying the US leader had “very little understanding” of how the US military worked after tweeting his support for an officer involved in a war crimes case.

Photograph: James Field/James Field Photography   **Mention “earthships” and it sounds like you’ve wandered deep into a hippie alternative paradigm. **But for a regular South Australian couple, facing a $450,000 bill to join the grid, suddenly a sustainable house wasn’t just a Mother Gaia-approved option but also a big money saver. So what are earthships? Effectively a passive solar shelter made from recycled materials with an emphasis on passive heating, writes Natalie Parletta.

 **A chance encounter on a train brings Brigid Delaney face to face with a woman grieving profoundly.** How do you respond? And what can you do to help that person – a stranger – in this time of loss? “The asymmetry lies in the moment the bereaved looks into the face of the stranger and sees her much-missed son or her sister, and the stranger looks back and sees just another stranger,” writes Delaney.

 The issue at the heart of Westpac’s recent Austrac scandal was identified by a staff member in 2017, writes **the Financial Review**, but the warnings got lost in a complex internal hierarchy. A two-part podcast launching in **the Courier Mail** will examine the re-opening of Australia’s second oldest cold case, the disappearance in 1972 of policewoman Gaye Baker. And tributes have flowed around the world for Dutch football coach and former Socceroos manager Pim Verbeek, who died following a battle with cancer aged 63, reports **the Sydney Morning Herald**.
