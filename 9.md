## 'Ensuring integrity' union bill defeated in Senate as One Nation votes with Labor – as it happenedWell, that has been quite the day!

 There will be a few rough heads from the government side early tomorrow morning, methinks. Because even if you don’t drink, you’d probably want to take it up after those last few days.  


 A week is a long time in politics and next week the government could be in a completely different position. But for right now, Labor MPs return back to their electorates secure they have had a small win.

 They’ll all be back on Monday though, with medevac the big legislative ticket item. The **Angus Taylor **issue will still be ticking over. As will the fallout from One Nation’s last minute switch on IR.

 Make sure you check back on the Guardian for the latest on all of that over the next few days – you’ll have all the news and analysis you would need until the blog is back for the final sitting week on Monday.

 Sadly, I will not be with you. I have been called away on personal business, meaning I will miss the final week. It’s not goodbye though – I’ll be back on the blog in February when parliament returns for 2020. Let me just say though this year, it has been an absolute pleasure and honour to steer the politics live ship. You guys make turning up to work a dream. As do the entire Canberra team – **Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin **and **Paul Karp** – and the rest of the Guardian brains trust. I am truly sorry I miss the final week of 2019 batshit insanity, but I will be with you in spirit. And I know that **Chris Knaus **will take very good care of you all for the final four sitting days. 

 I hope you all have a wonderful holiday period and summer. I hope your Christmas, if that’s your thing, is full of love and laughter. I hope you get time doing the things and seeing the people who make you shine.

 You can find me on the socials if you need to send me any missives. Thank you for a wonderful year. And please – take care of you.
