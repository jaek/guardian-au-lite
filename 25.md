## Jacqui Lambie says she'll repeal medevac bill if her one demand is met – as it happenedWith the moderators closing up the comments, I am going to close up the blog for the night – but we will be back bright and early tomorrow morning for the last sitting day of the week. 

 In the Senate, **Hollie Hughes **is still getting upset about robodebt being referred to as robodebt. Because yes, that is absolutely the issue here. What the program is referred to as. So yup – have made the right decision to close up the blog for the night. 

 Don’t expect medevac to come up between now and close of parliamentary business tomorrow. **Jacqui Lambie’s **statement is pointing to a lot more negotiations – which means we will most likely not see it again until next week.

 But we will keep you up to date with that, and whatever else happens.

 As will **Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Katharine Murphy **and** Paul Karp, **along with all the other people who keep the blog running – including the moderators who work their arses off making sure we can all keep the conversation going without ending up in court.

 A big thank you to all of them, and of course to all of you. We will be back tomorrow morning. And please – take care of you
